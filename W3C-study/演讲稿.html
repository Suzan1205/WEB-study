<h1 style="text-align:center">Five amazing ways that you can make conversation with anyone</h1>

<p>Dear teacher and fellow students, good morning/good noon.</p>

<p>Today, I want to talk about five amazing ways that you can make conversation with anyone.
I’m going to start with a question: So do you remember the first conversation that you ever had with that person? 
A conversation, it's a fascinating thing, a conversation is an adventure. A conversation gives you a whole new perspective. A conversation opens a door. The conversations can make war and can make peace. And conversations define who we are as a human race.
And think about this: every single person in your life was once a stranger to you. And you knew nothing about them until you had that first conversation. So I’m here today to tell you to talk to strangers and to have a conversation.
</p>

<p> Next, I tell you about five ways that you can make a conversation with almost anyone.
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue">First, take the initiative to speak. The first word flood gates.</p>
<p>
Strangers are everywhere and we’ve always been told don’t talk to strangers. However, every stranger comes with an opportunity — an opportunity to learn something new, an opportunity to have an experience you never had  or hear a story that you’ve never heard before. You see a stranger and you think  I want to talk to this person and you can almost hear the first word but it just won’t come out, it kind of get stuck about here, it kind of goes up and down. 
Don't be shy, the first sentence starts with a simple "hello", it is like a flood gate, and it can communicate naturally after opening.
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue"> Step two. Find the “me too”s. </p>
<p>
When you meet someone for the first time, make an effort to find the one thing that you and that other person might have in common. When you start at that point and then move outward from there, you will find that all of a sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier. And that’s because the both of you are suddenly on the same side of something. And that’s really a powerful feeling.
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue"> Three, Pay a unique and genuine compliment.</p>
<p>
I read somewhere that people will forget what you do and they’ll forget what you say but they will never forget how you made them feel. So try and construct a nice full compliment that’s unique and genuine，and you don’t have to lie.
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue"> Let me begain to the next point. Be present</p>
<p>
When someone’s trying to communicate with you, the least you can do is really be in that conversation, just be wholeheartedly present (全心全意). Just be there.  And all my favorite part: make eye contact. Trust me, eye contact is where all the magic happens. You can feel the conversation and trust me, when you’re looking at someone in the eye, nine out of 10 times they will not dare look away. Right?
</p>

<p style="font-family:verdana;color:blue">Last one, Remember the little details about a person (name, place, animal, thing)</p>
<p>
All little things about people ---such as the places they like to go to, the places they’ve been to, the places they want to go to, their pet’s names, the things they like, their children’s names, their wife’s renames, and their girlfriend’s names.
Remember these little things about people and repeat it back to them, ask be genuinely interested and automatically you kind of become an investor in their well-being. So they feel responsible to you to keep that conversation going.
</p>

<p>There we go. Five amazing ways and reasons that you can make conversation with anyone. You should come up to talk to a stranger if you don’t know.
</p>
<p>I’m going to end with this analogy.  A conversation is like reading a book. You can turn to any page you want. You can flip to your favorite chapter. You can read as long as you want and you can read what you want and every person is a really good book. So what are you going to do in this big world that we call the library? Are we going to walk around and look at the hard bound copies and read the titles? 
Or are you going to actually reach for a book, open a page and start reading a story. You decide.
</p>

<p>That's all. Thank you.</p>
